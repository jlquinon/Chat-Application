# Chat-Application
Two-way chat communication using WebSockets

## Foreword
This application was built on a Windows 10 64-bit system. I have not tried the application on any other operating system. Please follow the guidelines to ensure proper functionality.

## Usage
You will first need to download [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to ensure the application will work on a personal machine.

Once Node.JS has been installed, the socketchat library is required for handling two way communication, such as authenticating and storing socket information, and can be downloaded on the command line using
```
npm install socketchat
```
